# Interactive Storybook

An experimental interactive HTML storybook exploring how narrative techniques can be used as training material for scientists. 

## About

This project is a **playful experiment** in transforming scientific content into storybook format. The content itself is somewhat tongue-in-cheek - the real purpose is to explore how storybooks, interactive narratives, and other creative techniques can be effective training tools for researchers and academics.

## Features

- Interactive navigation (click, keyboard, touch/swipe)
- Responsive design for all devices
- Custom SVG illustrations
- Smooth page transitions
- GitHub Pages ready

## Purpose

- **Test narrative training methods** for scientific audiences
- **Explore interactive storytelling** as educational tool
- **Evaluate AI-assisted content creation** for training materials
- **Experiment with engaging formats** beyond traditional documentation

## Demo

ðŸ”— **[Live Demo](https://thomasgerdes.github.io/mpg-storybook/)**

## Technical

- Standalone HTML5 file
- No external dependencies
- Modern browser support
- Mobile-friendly

## Context

Created entirely with AI assistance to test creative approaches to scientific training and communication. The Max-Planck content serves as a lighthearted example - the focus is on the technique, not the specific subject matter.
